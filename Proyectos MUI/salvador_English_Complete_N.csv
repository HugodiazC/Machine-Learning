Rector Don Salvador, I thank you: FOR BEING AND BEING A PARADIGM OF YOUR WORK. HIS SERENE AND JOVIAL FACE INVITES YOU TO LISTEN AND REFLECT, TO FACE THE CHALLENGES TO COME. NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT INNOVATING IS INNOVATING. AND YOU HAVE DONE IT AT THE TEC. HIS BOOKS ARE LEGACY. I USED THEM WITH MY FOREIGN STUDENTS AT EGADE. WHERE THEY LEARNED THE LANGUAGE AND THE READINGS OF THEIR BOOKS, AND ABOVE ALL THEY OPENED THE DEBATE. MUST BE HIGHLIGHTED, THAT THEY WERE SURPRISED, BEING MEXICANS (AS MUCH AS YOU DON JOSÉ A.FDZ), THAT THEY KNOW AND WILL TALK ABOUT GLOBAL ISSUES AS CURRENT. ESPECIALLY WHEN I WORKED WITH SOME KOREANS I QUOTE THE PART WHERE YOU ARE. THEY SPEAK OF THE KOREAN MIRACLE.
FINALLY, I WISH YOU THE BEST IN THE WORLD. RECOMMENDATION: WRITE WE MAY BE CO-AUTHORS FOR OUR LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND BUSINESS. ALWAYS GRATEFUL. GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. PEACE AND GOOD
Thank you for your immense wisdom and love for the Institution and each one of the people who we had the fortune to meet you through your books, speeches, messages and decisions. God bless you.
